# w4sp-threat-intel
The "W4SP stealer" malware steals personal information, security credentials, and valuable files from victims. Most antivirus software does **not** detect it.

The network of criminals behind W4SP has repeatedly used it to attack the open-source supply chain, causing considerable economic damage and personally harming developers. The attacks are ongoing.

By aggregating the public data trails of known threat-actors, we have elucidated a partial, but exceptionally granular topology of the w4sp network and associated threat-space:

This repository contains over 3,000 open-source data points tied to individuals suspected of culpability for the recent w4sp attacks. 

Including:
- domains
- IP addresses
- open ports
- email addresses
- public keys
- ssl certs
- server software 
- web technologies
- social media profiles
- passive dns 
- http headers
- co-hosted sites
- subdomains 
- linked content 
- spidered addresses
- raw RIR data
- exposed databases
- exposed remote desktops
- and more 

We invite you to fork this repo and add to the list. We have only scratched the surface.
